# supported-rpc-methods
Website displaying which methods are supported by which common rpc endpoints

While waiting for the `supportsMethod` method, we can query different enpoints for every JSON-RPC method and construct a table of supported methods. This could then be used to select an appropriate RPC endpoint.
